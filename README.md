## Project Overview
A certain firm in the United States is focused on distributing 15 candy products to customers across the country and Canada. The company has 5 factories and its products are classified under 3 divisions namely; chocolate, sugar, and others. In this analysis, the goal is to examine the business sales, profits, and trends across the 4-year period starting from 2021 to 2024. In the end, I will make some recommendations based on the insights derived from querying the data.

## Data Source
The source of this data is Maven Analytics. The dataset can be accessed in this [link](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?order=date_added%2Cdesc&search=us%20candy).

## Tools
The primary tools used for cleaning, analyzing and visualizing the insights from this dataset are Excel and Power BI.

## Data Cleaning
Cleaning this dataset required;
 + a. Checking for and removing null values.
 + b. Using the Power Query ETL platform to format values correctly and insert the right column names.
 + c. Modelling relationships to relate tables using the appropriate primary and foreign keys.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The following questions were analyzed from the dataset:
+ What are the most efficient factory to customer shipping routes?
+ What about the least efficient?
+ Which product lines have the best product margin?
+ Which product lines should be moved to a different factory to optimize shipping routes?
